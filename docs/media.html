            <h2>About the Campaign</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Remembrance Lost</strong> is a character-driven, two-player cooperative campaign designed
                for D&D 5e. One player takes the role of DM/narrator while simultaneously controlling Augustus,
                the Oathkeeper paladin, while the other player controls Elara, a druid protagonist. The campaign
                explores themes of memory, devotion, betrayal, and the bonds that define us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elara awakens in Azzurro City with complete amnesia—no memory of her past, her motivations, or
                even her companion Augustus. Her last conscious moment was an attack by cultists of Malachor,
                a corrupted archmage who has turned to forbidden Feywild pacts to dominate the natural world.
                Augustus, bound by his sacred Oath of Devotion to Elara, takes up the burden of guiding her
                journey, knowing she must restore her memories to prevent catastrophe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Together, they must travel across the Azure Coast—through pristine white cities, divine shrines,
                ancient forests, and a corrupted island fortress—to recover the Sanctuary Bloom and place it
                within the Nexus, a sacred site of ancient druidic power. Their success will not only restore
                Elara's memories but save the wildlands themselves from crystallization and corruption.
            </p>

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: #1a1a1a; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Augustus - Paladin of Torm</h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    Augustus is a paladin of Torm, the Loyal Fury, bound by the sacred Oath of Devotion. Unlike many
                    of his order who dedicate themselves to abstract ideals of justice and law, Augustus's oath took
                    a far more personal form. He swore himself to a single individual, making Elara not merely someone
                    he protects, but his devotion, the living embodiment of everything his sacred vows represent.

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: #1a1a1a; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Elara - Druid of the Circle of the Land</h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    Elara is a druid who once called the Seaside Manor in Azzurro City her home. Born to a wealthy
                    family of the Azure Coast's elite, she was drawn to the natural world from a young age. She has
                    lost her memory and can remember neither her own past, her motivations, nor the history of her
                    companion Augustus. She does remember her druidic skills.
                </p>

                <h4 style="font-size: 1.3rem; color: #1a1a1a; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Malachor the Unbinder</h4>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    Malachor was once a respected archmage of Azzurro City who became obsessed with unbinding the
                    boundary between the Material Plane and the Feywild. His plan is both elegant and terrible:
                    by unbinding the druidic's divine link to the wildlands and bringing corrupt Feywild magic to
                    the Azure Coast, he will cause the wildland's magic to crystallize, becoming a resource he
                    alone can harvest and command.
